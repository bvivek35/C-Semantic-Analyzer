A Semantic Analyser for C.

This is a small project taking C source file and checks for a function call and declaration semantics.
It provides o/p onto stdout, in a neat format.
It also aims to provide meaningful error messages.

The implementation aims to keep a symbol table, which will be referred to at point of matching.
The tokenizing of the source file will be done using PLY(Python Lex & Yacc).

I hope someone will find this useful...
